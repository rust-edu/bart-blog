## About Bart Massey and Rust-Edu

I'm [Bart Massey](https://www.cs.pdx.edu/~bart), an
Associate Professor at [Portland State
University](https://pdx.edu).

I am the founder and currently one of the leads of
[Rust-Edu](https://rust-edu.org), an organization initially
funded by a generous gift from Futurewei. The primary goal
of Rust-Edu is to get Rust into University curricula
worldwide, but we also are working hard on general Rust
education, learning, teaching and training. Please check us
out!
